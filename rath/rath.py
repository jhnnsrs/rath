    Links are used to define the transport logic of the Rath. A Rath can be
    connected to a GraphQL API using a terminating link. By composing links to
    form a chain, you can define the transport logic of the client.

    For example, a Rath can be connected to a GraphQL API over HTTP by
    composing an HTTP terminating link with a RetryLink. The RetryLink will
    retry failed requests, and the HTTP terminating link will send the
    requests over HTTP.

    Example:
        ```python
        from rath import Rath
        from rath.links.retry import RetryLink
        from rathlinks.aiohttp import AIOHttpLink

        retry = RetryLink()
